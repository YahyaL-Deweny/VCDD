# VCDD

#The code called "Stopping Distance" ------> is the one for the normal case ( horizontal ).

#The code could vary the values of the car velocity, mass, and dynamic friction coefficient as well as the reaction time of the driver,
   based on the fact that they are all user inputs!
   
#As for the code called "Inclined", it could also vary the values of the car velocity, and dynamic friction coefficient as well as
   the reaction time of the driver, but not the mass of the car as the calculation of the deceleration in that case
   is independent of the mass of the car.
